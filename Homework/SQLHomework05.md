1. What is a table expression? Can you give a technical deﬁnition of a table expression?
``A named query expression that represents a valid relational table.``
2. In what SQL clause are derived tables (table valued subqueries) located?
``In the from clause of the outer query.``
3. Why can you refer to column aliases in an outer query that you deﬁned in an inner table valued subquery?
``Because the inner table valued subquery is run first.``
4. What SQL key word deﬁnes a common table expression?
``WITH``
5. When using common table expressions, can a subsequent derived table use a table alias declared in a preceding table expression?
``Yes, because the preceding expression was run first.``
6. Can a main query refer to a previously deﬁned common table expression by multiple aliases?
``Yes, because CTEs are run and stored in memory.``
7. In SQL, is a view a durable object?
``Yes, because it stores the query in memory.``
8. In a view, what does WITH CHECK OPTION do? Why is this important?
``It prevents modifications that conflict with the views filter.``
9. In a view, what does SCHEMABINDING do? Why is this important?
``It binds the schema of referenced objects and columns to the schema of the referencing object. Without it, changes can be made that lead to run time errors.``
10. What is a table valued function?
``A view with parameters, basically.``
11. What does the APPLY operator do?
``Runs the subquery for every row of the outer query.``
12. What are the two forms of the APPLY operator? Give an example of each.


CROSS APPLY and OUTER APPLY.
SELECT S.shipperid, E.empid
FROM Sales.Shippers AS S   
  CROSS APPLY HR.Employees AS E;

SELECT C.custid, A.orderid, A.orderdate
FROM Sales.Customers AS C
  OUTER APPLY    
  (SELECT TOP (3) orderid, empid, orderdate, requireddate
  FROM Sales.Orders AS O
    WHERE O.custid = C.custid      
    ORDER BY orderdate DESC, orderid DESC) AS A;
