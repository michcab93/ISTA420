1. The sales tax rate for a state just changed. How would you update the state sales tax table to reï¬‚ect the changes? Assume that this table has an ID column, a RATE column, and a STATE column.

``UPDATE dbo.taxes SET RATE = (ratechange) WHERE ID/STATE = ID/'State';``

2. The Revenue Division has requested that you provide a report on what the actual sales taxes would have been for all orders in the past year, assuming the retroactivity of the new sales tax rate. How would you calculate this?

`` Create a new table with SELECT INTO with the data from the old table and update the new table with the new sales tax.``

3. Explain how the proprietary assignment update command works.

``Updates and assigns at the same time.``

4. What is one very important purpose of the MERGE SQL statement? What is ETL (not in book)?

``ETL (Extract, transform, load). data transformation``

5. What are the semantics of MERGE?

``MERGE INTO ____ AS TGT, USING ____ AS SRC, ON, WHEN MATCHED THEN, UPDATE SET, WHEN NOT MATCHED THEN, INSERT VALUES``

6. Write a typical INSERT OUTPUT statement.

``INSERT INTO ____ OUTPUT ____ SELECT FROM WHERE``

7. Write a typical UPDATE OUTPUT statement.

``UPDATE SET OUTPUT WHERE``

8. Write a typical DELETE OUTPUT statement.

``DELETE FROM OUTPUT WHERE``

9. Write a typical MERGE OUTPUT statement.

``MERGE INTO USING ON TGT.____ = SRC.____ WHEN MATCHED THEN UPDATE SET ____ WHEN NOT MATCHED INSERT VALUES OUTPUT``

10. What is nested DML?

``Directly inserts the subset of rows needed from the modified rows into the final target table.``
