-- 1. List the number of orders by each customer who lives in the United States
-- using a CTE. Sort from highest to lowest.



with USAcust as

(

select customerid

from customers

	where country = 'USA'

)

select o.customerid, count(o.orderid) as numord

from orders o

	where o.customerid in USAcust

	group by o.customerid

	order by numord desc;



-- 2. List the product name and the number of each product from a German supplier
-- sold to a customer in Germany using a CTE. Sort from highest to lowest.



with GerProd as

	(

	select p.productid, p.productname, s.supplierid, s.country

	from products p

		join suppliers s

			on p.supplierid = s.supplierid

	where s.country = 'Germany'

	),

GerOrd as

	(

	select od.productid, od.orderid, od.quantity, o.shipcountry

	from orders o

		join order_details od

			on od.orderid = o.orderid

	where o.shipcountry = 'Germany'

	)



select GP.productname, sum(GO.quantity) as numprod

from GerProd GP

	join GerOrd GO

		on GP.productid = GO.productid

group by GP.productid

order by numprod desc;



-- 3. Prepare an employee report showing the name of each employee, the number
-- of employees they supervise, and the name of their supervisor using a CTE.
-- Sort by the number of employees supervised.





-- 4. One purpose of views is to denormalize databases for the purpose of eﬃciency,
-- both machine eﬃciency and programmer eﬃciency. Creating denormalized objects
-- can turn complex queries into simple ones. For example, suppose you needed a
-- list of all employees who took orders for a speciﬁc customer, or all customers
-- who were served by a speciﬁc employee. You can create a “table” as a view
-- that contains distinct pairs of customers and employees. This is somewhat
-- complex, so do this in steps.



--(a) Create a query that returns every distinct customer/employee pair.





-- (b) Use that query to write another query turning the customerid, customername, and customercontact,

--  and the employeeid, ﬁrstname, and lastname.



-- (c) Make sure you drop any view that might exist.



-- (d) Create a view based on your query.



-- (e) Write a report listing all customers served by employee 7, Robert King.



-- (f) Write a report listing all employees who served customer CHOPS, Chop-suey Chinese.



-- (g) Drop the view.
